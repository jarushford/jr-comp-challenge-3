Recreate a static site based on the provided comp. Creative liberty may be taken with the copy, images, and icons, provided they make sense. Creative liberty may not be taken with the layout. Use of a CSS Normalize file should be employed. The layout must be responsive and compatible with Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari.
